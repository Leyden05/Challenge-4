# Challenge-4
Challenge 4 for coding camp yay!

This Challenge, we were asked to make a quiz with a timer function that will subtract time if the user gets the answer wrong. This version has a faulty points version that logs into the console, but not to the user. It is styled using a coolors.co color palette.

James Q Quick: Used a good amount throughout this quiz to help garner an understanding of the quiz. Some of his code is here.
